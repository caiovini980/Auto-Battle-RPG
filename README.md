 # Kokku Software Engineer Applicant Test

## Auto Battle RPG

This application is an auto-battle RPG that has a grid with cells/tiles/boxes organized as a matrix. Your goals are to fix the program, polish the code and implement an extra feature [(as detailed below)](#extra-features).

### Requisites

- This test must be done exclusively as a console application. Do not use any engines
- The solution must compile, and the game must be playable from start to finish
- You **must** use git for source control. You can setup a repository in whichever host you prefer. Please give access to the following account: `dev@kokku.com.br`
  - Your usage of git will be evaluated
- You are free to modify the scripts as much as you want
  - Adding, removing or modifying existing scripts are all acceptable 
  - You will be evaluated on your capacity to write clean, performant and maintainable code, following healthy design principles
- Please document the changes you make to the code
  - Provide brief explanations for your changes. You don't need to document every single line you modify

### Game Rules

On startup, the game must ask the player to pick a class and a battlefield size. The enemy character must be randomly chosen. Both characters must be randomly assigned a tile in the battlefield, and take turns to try to kill their opponent. The functionality of the program will also be evaluated. Below are some rules that must be followed:

- Each character should only perform one action per turn
    - If they are within range of a target, they must attack. Otherwise, they will move toward the nearest target
    - Your [extra feature](#extra-features) may add some extra actions that can be done in a turn
- The game should work with a battlefield of any size, including a non-square matrix (6x6 or 6x10, for example)
- The game should inform the player when the battle ends, and who was victorious
- The battlefield should only be reprinted/redrawn if there have been any visual changes to it
- Only one character is allowed per tile
- Try to make the program as dynamic as possible
    - Avoid hard-coded rules such as "the player always moves first"

### Tips and avaliation criteria

Keep in mind the code has a lot of malpractices of different difficulties, find and refactor the majority (Aim to clean all of them), or remove them from the project.
Our team will look into different aspects of your code, but a good and important starting point is the architecture, readability, and if the code is clean and well organized.

### Extra Features

**Important - Make sure to inform which feature you’re going to work on.

Pick one of the following:

- Every class must implement a "Status Effect" that can be applied to other characters. Examples:
    - "Bleed": Damages the affected target every turn for a limited time
    - "Knock down": Stops the affected target from doing any actions in their next turn
    - "Heal": Heals the affected target
- Every class must implement a "Special Ability" that can be randomly performed. Examples:
    - "Knockback": Knowck the target back one tile
    - "Strong attack": Deals 2x attack damage to a target
    - "Teleport": Teleports the character to any tile
    - "Invisibility": Makes the character "hidden", stopping enemies from chasing or attacking
    - "Throw rock": Character can damage a target from far away
- Instead of only 2 characters, the game must have two opposing teams. The player can still pick their character's class. When a team is completely wiped out, they lose.

(You can add all of them if you want)
